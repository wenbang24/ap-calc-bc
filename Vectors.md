Vector: directed line segment
Magnitude:$||v||=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$
Direction: $\theta=\arctan({y\over x})$
Equivalent Vectors: same magnitude & direction, not necessarily same starting point.
Component form: $\langle x,y\rangle$
Standard position: start from the origin
**Note:** to convert from magnitude & direction to component form, refer to [[Polar Graphs#Conversion]].
