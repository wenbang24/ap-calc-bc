# What the actual f\*\*k is a differential equation
Literally just equations with derivatives in them.
This course only does differential equations where you can separate the variables
# Solving differential equations
1. $y'\rightarrow\frac{dy}{dx}$
2. Multiply both sides by dx (if necessary)
3. Separate variables
4. Integrate both sides (remember +C)
5. Solve for y
6. (depends on question) Solve for C
Note: if you get two answers (e.g. $\pm$ or absolute value) use the initial condition to figure out which one is the more appropriate solution
## Example
$$
\displaylines{x+2yy'=0\\x+2y{dy\over dx}=0\\x\,dx+2y\,dy=0\\2y\,dy=-x\,dx\\\int2y\,dy=-\int x\,dx\\y^2=-{x^2\over2}+C\\y=\sqrt{-{x^2\over2}+C}\text{ or }-\sqrt{-{x^2\over2}+C}}
$$
