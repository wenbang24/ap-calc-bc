For when you want to be tiringly lazy: A more precise method of graphing an approximate solution to a differential equation.$$
\Delta y = \text{slope} \times \Delta x
$$Use $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ to fill in a table of x and y values (add $\Delta$ values to current x and y, put that in next row).
Smaller step size ($\Delta x$) gives more precise answer.
