Changing to rectangular form: writing y in terms of x.
1. Solve for t in terms of x
2. Substitute into equation for y
3. Simplify
4. Solve for minimum x or y by plugging in minimum t into equation for x or y
Alternatively, do something else (e.g. add/subtract the equations) to eliminate the parameter.
# Differentiating
Even if equations are given with a parameter, you can still find dy/dx.$$
\displaylines{{dy\over dx}={{dy\over dt}\over{dx\over dt}}\\{d^2y\over dx^2}={{{d\over dt}\left({dy\over dx}\right)}\over{dx\over dt}}}
$$
# Arc Length
If a curve is smooth and does not intersect itself, the arc length is:$$
\int_a^b\sqrt{\left({dx\over dt}\right)^2+\left({dy\over dt}\right)^2}dt
$$
