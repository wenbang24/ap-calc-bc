# Critical Numbers
Values where $f(x)$ exists but $f'(x)$ is either zero or undefined
# Extreme Value Theorem
A function that is continuous on $[a, b]$ attains an absolute maximum and minimum on that interval.
# Finding Global Extrema
1. Find all critical numbers
2. Find all corresponding y-values of critical numbers **and** y-values at the end of the interval
3. Choose largest and smallest
## Using 1st derivative + increasing/decreasing
[[2024-11-02]]
1. Find domain restrictions
2. Find critical numbers [[#Critical Numbers]]
	1. $f'(x)=0$ or $f'(x)$ is undefined, domain restrictions are not critical numbers
3. Locate domain restrictions and critical numbers on number line
4. Test sign of $f'(x)$ on each interval (just pick an x value on each interval), label signs
5. List increasing/decreasing intervals, identify min/max points
	1. Each CN/DR is a min/max point (or asymptote)
	2. $f'(x)=0$ or does not exist
When sign of $f'(x)$ changes there is a relative extrema
DON'T FORGET DOMAIN ENDPOINTS
## Using 2nd derivative + concavity
[[2024-11-02]]
### Concavity
#### Concave upward
Tangent line is below the graph (up is positive = smiley face) $f''(x)>0$ or $f'(x)$ is increasing
#### Concave downward
Tangent line is above the graph (down is negative = frowny face) $f''(x)<0$ or $f'(x)$ is decreasing

Although if $f''(x)=0$ over an interval (e.g. $y=3x$) then it has no concavity
#### Point of inflection
When the graph has a tangent line and concavity changes (e.g. $f(x)=x^3$, $(0,0)$ is point of inflection) - find when $f''(x)=0$ at a point
### Finding relative extrema
Note: DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK, use use only if directions/given info require it
Find critical numbers first with 1st derivative ($f'(x)=0$)
$f''(CN)>0$ CN is x-value of relative minimum
$f''(CN)<0$ CN is x-value of relative maximum
$f''(CN)=0$ CN is x-value of point of inflection
Do the number line thing again
Note: $f''$ needs to change sign for point of inflection
