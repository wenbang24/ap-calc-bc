Useful for series involving factorials or exponentials$$
\sum a_n\text{ converges if }\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left|{a_{n+1}\over a_n}\right|<1
$$If ratio is greater than 1 or infinity then it diverges.
**If ratio is equal to 1, then the test is inconclusive.**
If ratio is less than 1 then it converges.
