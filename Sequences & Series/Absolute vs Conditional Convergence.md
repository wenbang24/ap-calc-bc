Suppose $\sum a_n$ converges, where some of $a_n$ are negative.
If $\sum |a_n|$ (which is greater bc of the absolute value) converges, then the original series is **absolutely convergent**.
If the new series with absolute values diverges, then the original series is **conditionally convergent**.
If a series converges after taking the absolute value of its terms, it is guaranteed to also converge without the absolute values.
