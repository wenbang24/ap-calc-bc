# Function Graphs
- Find domain
- Reduce function
- Find vertical asymptotes & holes
- Find x & y intercepts
- Find end behavior
- Find increasing/decreasing intervals & relative extrema ($f'$ number line)
- Find concavity & points of inflection ($f''$ number line)
- Graph!
# Antiderivative Graphs
- Make $f'$ number line to find increasing/decreasing sections
- Make $f''$ number line using the slopes of the $f'$ graph to find points of inflection & concavity
- Graph - if no starting point is given you can shift the graph vertically
